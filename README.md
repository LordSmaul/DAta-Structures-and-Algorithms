# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This folder contains all of the programming assignments from my Data Structures and Algorithms. Most of the class was not as focused on memorizing all types of algorithms that we could potentially use in our field. It was instead more of a mathematical analysis of popular algorithms that are used in the industry and how they work within the code. However, there were some assignments that were given to test our ability write different types of these algorithms. All of these programs were written within a shared folder with a Vagrant file that set up a VM environment for us to work in.

**Here is a breakdown of each program and their purpose. All relevant in-depth documentation is included in each file.**

Program 1: Recursive implementation of the Euclidian algorithm for calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) between two input numbers.

Program 2: Brute force algorithm for finding the largest number in vector from file input. I wrote a separate file that inserts numbers into a .txt file as a way of randomizing the tests myself.

Program 3: Brute Force solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem by finding the Hamiltonian cycle of least cost for an input graph, should one exist. The graph input is obtained from a .txt file and is stored in an adjacency matrix.

Program 4: Recursive decrease-and-conquer approach to finding the largest number in a vector from file input.

Program 5: Calculating the Levenshtein distance (aka edit distance) between two input strings using a Dynamic Programming technique.
